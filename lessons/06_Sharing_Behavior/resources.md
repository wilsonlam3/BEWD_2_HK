###More on Modules: Namespacing

* We can define methods/classes with the same name, but namespaced differently
* We would do this if (in example below) we wanted the Bat to behave differently depending on which namespace it belongs to
* You will rarely use module namespacing (not at all in this course)

  module Animal
    class Bat
      def fly!
        puts "So free.. and blind"
      end
    end
  end

  Animal::Bat.new

  module Baseball
    class Bat
      def made_of
        "wood"
      end
    end
  end

  Baseball::Bat.new

###Sharing Behavior

Good code should be reused!

###Cheat Sheet

####load vs. require vs. include

Why do they all sound the same??!!!!

* load: inserts a file's contents
  * File can be loaded more than once.

    ```load 'config.rb'```

* require inserts parsed contents: We use it to require a class in another .rb file.
  * File is only required once.

    ```require 'config'```

* include 'mixes in' modules. Use to include modules and mixins.

    ```include 'my_module'```

####Inheritance
* One class can inherit the capabilities of another using ```<```
* Sub-class inherits from super-class
(child class inherits from parent class)

* If defined in different physical files, a child must require its parent

-- lib/person.rb ---

```ruby
  class Person
  end

```

--- lib/worker.rb ---

```ruby

  require 'lib/person'

  class Worker < Person
  end
```

Heres a lengthy example:

* Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
* Don't do this!

```ruby
  class ScienceSubteddit
      @@name = "Science"
      @@description = "Where we blow stuff up for fun"
      def self.welcome
        puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
        puts @@description
      end
  end

  class MoviesSubteddit
      @@name = "Movies"
      @@description = "Because the Matrix was awesome"
      def self.welcome
        puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
        puts @@description
      end
  end

  class SportsSubteddit
      @@name = "Sports"
      @@description = "We have big muscles and we run fast"
      def self.welcome
        puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
        puts @@description
      end
  end

  class RubySubteddit
      @@name = "Ruby"
      @@description = "Because Python Sucks"
      def self.welcome
        puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
        puts @@description
      end
  end
```


* This is a better approach and demonstrates the benefit of using Object Oriented programming.
  * News sections inherit from Subteddit.


```ruby
  class Subteddit
      @@name = ""
      @@description = ""
      def self.welcome
        puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
        puts @@description
      end
  end

  class ScienceSubteddit < Subteddit
      @@name = "Science"
      @@description = "Where we blow stuff up for fun"
  end

  class MoviesSubteddit < Subteddit
      @@name = "Movies"
      @@description = "Because the Matrix was awesome"
  end

  class SportsSubteddit < Subteddit
      @@name = "Sports"
      @@description = "We have big muscles and we run fast"
  end

  class RubySubteddit < Subteddit
      @@name = "Ruby"
      @@description = "Because Python Sucks"
  end
```

####Mixins

* Include a module in a class to access the module's methods. This also keeps code DRY.

```ruby
  module MyModule
      def module_method(parameters)
        return parameter
      end
  end
```

```ruby
  class MyClass
    include MyModule
  end


  my_object = MyClass.new
  my_object.module_method
```

####Modules

Ruby exposes much core functionality through modules

A commonly used built in module is Math
The :: operator is used to refer to a constant set in a module

```ruby
  puts Math.sqrt(9)
```

>3.0


```ruby
  puts Math::PI
```
>3.1415926


* A module is like a class, except
  * You cannot create a new instance of a module
  * You cannot extend a module to create a child module


* Modules are a way to add namespaces

Ruby docs have a full list of available modules.


__Method Scope__

```ruby
  class GA_course
    def initialize (course_name)
      @course_name = course_name
    end

    def announce_course
      puts "GA has a course on #{@course_name}"
    end

    def self.announce_courses
      puts "GA has a course on BEWD"
      puts "GA has a course on FEWD"
      puts "GA has a course on CSF"
      puts "GA has a course on DAT"
      puts "GA has a course on UXD"
      puts "GA has a course on PDM"
    end
  end

  my_course = GA_course.new("BEWD")
  my_course.announce_course #
  GA_Course.announce_courses
```

>GA has a course on BEWD

>GA has a course on BEWD
>GA has a course on FEWD
>GA has a course on CSF
>GA has a course on DAT
>GA has a course on UXD
>GA has a course on PDM


###Still Feel Lost?

Its ok, we will see these terms again in Rails, but you can also,
