#Secret Number Specs
##Time: 25 minutes

1. Complete the secret number program
2. Finish writing the tests for the program. All tests should pass
3. Add three more tests: what should happen when the guess is outside the minimum and maximum range allowed? What about when the guess is not an integer? Again, all tests should pass
