Title : My Blog Website

What is the purpose of your website?
==> The purpose of my website is simply have a voice of articles I wanted to share. It also serves as the guide when I need to recall a specific piece of code or just want to browse through the examples of coding of what I had learned in web development and programming topics such as Ruby on Rails, APIs, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, Specs, Mashups, GeoMaps, and more to come.
